npx parcel index.html: means we are executing an npm pacakage parcel and source file is index.html
the command is diff for prod build and dev build
to make our life easier, we will write an script to run the project instead of the large command.
we have to add script in pacakage.json
if you go in company and dont know how to start project, then go to script in package.json



now we will run the project using npm run start or npm start
npm run build: this will build our project. This is how we build the project for production

npm run start = npm start
but for build, it will not work


npm parcel index.html: will not work. npx parcel index.html will work
npx start will also not work. Only npm start will work
