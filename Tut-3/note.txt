npx parcel index.html: means we are executing an npm pacakage parcel and source file is index.html
the command is diff for prod build and dev build
to make our life easier, we will write an script to run the project instead of the large command.
we have to add script in pacakage.json
if you go in company and dont know how to start project, then go to script in package.json



now we will run the project using npm run start or npm start
npm run build: this will build our project. This is how we build the project for production

npm run start = npm start
but for build, it will not work


npm parcel index.html: will not work. npx parcel index.html will work
npx start will also not work. Only npm start will work

//dom element are html element
//React Element: it is an element equivalent to dom element

react element is not an html element

react element is an object at the end of the day
when we render this element onto dom, it becomes an html element.

// react element is an oobject
when we render, then the powerful lib readtdom takes the object and convert it to html and push to browser.


push means it will replace what ever inside root.



React.createElement is not a good way. It is like html inside js
but syntax is bad

so developers created jsx: js syntax to create react element eaisly

jsx is not part of react
we can write react without jsx also


const jsxheading=<h1>Hello Using JSX🚀</h1>


//dom element are html element
//React Element: it is an element equivalent to dom element
// react element is an oobject

const jsxheading = <h1 id="heading">Hello Using JSX🚀</h1>//jsx //jsx is diff then html //this code is eq to react.createElement code //create react element using jsx

//jsx is html like syntax //xml like syntax

//jsx is react elelemnet? no it's a syntax

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(jsxheading);
console.log(jsxheading); //object same as react.createElement


//now we will use jsx
jsx is not pure javascript

//any js code is understand by js engine
js engine will not understand jsx
js engine understand ecmascript


//js engine not able to read jsx code. Then how it is printed?
parcel doing it's job
even before this code is goes to js enine, it is transpilled be4 it goes to js enine.
js engine recive the code that browser can read
jsx code is transpilleld before it goes to js engine

transpilled: this code is coverted to the code that browser can understand

transpilling is done by parcel;


parcel doesnt do transpilling by itself
it manages everything

parcel using babel for transpilling

//Babel is a JavaScript compiler.
babael not created by facebook



jsx code is transpiled to react.createElement and then it js object. then it is rendered as html element.
jsx is coverted to react elelemnet

JSX=>React.createElement=>React element=>JS Object=>transpiled(Babel)=>HTML Element(Rendering)

babel is converting jsx code to react.createElement


jsx is behind the scene react.createElement

babel is a open source js compiler
babel's job is not just to create jsx to react element, it does lot of things
babel is js compiler, transpiller
old browser dont understand js es6 code, babel can change es6 code to older one.
babel is node lib, npm lib
parcel is manager of babel.


jsx is mix of js and html not exact html


when we need to give attribute in jsx, we give it in camelcase. className

//JSX stands for JavaScript XML


tabIndex attribute in html: set priority oder of html leemnt when tab button shift focus
if the jsx in single line it is valid jsx: const jsxheading = <h1 id="heading" className="jsxheading">Hello Using JSX🚀</h1>

but if jsx is in multiple line, you have to wrap it inside parenthesis. i.e () round bracket

-why we wrap up, bcs babel need to understand, where jsx started and where jsx ended. if its sinle line, no need

const jsxheading = (<h1 id="heading" className="jsxheading">Hello Using JSX🚀</h1>): valid and even without (), it is valid as it is single line jsx

if we write jsx in multiple lines, then () is mandatory

const jsxheading = (<h1 id="heading" className="jsxheading">
Hello Using JSX🚀
</h1>):

jsx:babel transpiled it to react.createElement and react.createElement is executed to react element and then it is rendred as html element

in the variable jsxheading, there is an object
