//now will bundle the package. Bundlers are most important package in our app.

have you heared webpack, parcel or vite? 
these are bundlers which bundels our packages or app to ship it to production.


when we create react app, then it uses webpack bundelers behind the scenes. uses webpack bundelers and bebel behind the scenes.

We will be using parcel.

For installing any pacakges/dependencies, we will have same command. npm install package-name

but will use npm install -D parcel: -D is parameter

there are 2 types of packages that we xcan install. 1 is dev dependencies and another is normal dependencies. 
bunding done in dev phase, so we will use dev dependencies.


now there will be devdependencies parcel in pacakage.json. 

 "devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.11.0" 
  }

//^: kerret  we can also put tilde~ over here.
diff bw ^ and ~: ^ means update it to minor version i.e latest updates. update dependencies to latest updates. ex: 2.11.7 etc. recommended to use latest version
~: means update dependencies to major version. for example, 3.1.0, 4.1.0: not recommended as it has major changes abnd updates.
